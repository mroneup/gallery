Dear Moon,
As you probably know, you could say i am not in the best shape mentally, and i have one thing to say: what the fuck is going on like holy shit
The worLD IS FUCKING TEARING ITSELF APART SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Like what is the point anymore? The very definition of existence is based on suffering. To live is to suffer. there IS NO FUCKING POINT ANYMORE. I AM SO FUCKING STRESSED I FAINT DURING MY ONLINE LESSONS. SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY GONNA KILL ME SOON, AND IF IT IS GOD, THE HE BETTER HURRY THE FUCK UP BECAUSE I'M FED UP WITH THIS BULLSHIT.
IF HE EXISTS, HE WEEPS, AND IF HE EXISTS, HE ABANDONED US A LONG TIME AGO. WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT!? JUST LAUNCH THE FUCKING NUKES. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA so to reiterate, yes, i am a strong advocate for the extinction of the human race.
I'm sorry for everything.
