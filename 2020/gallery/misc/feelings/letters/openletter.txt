Dear readers, A question to you.
What is the point of life?
As we have seen, life is only suffering.
Even the nicest things last way too short to bring us any form of long term happiness.
As you probably know, not all things in life have a reason.
As humans, we are unpredictable. you could sum us up into a few words.
Such as: Useless, Dumb, Weak.
Or: Annoying, mortal, nostalgic.
