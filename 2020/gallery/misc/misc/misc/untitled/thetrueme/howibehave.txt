And... I-I don't know if you ever get used to it, though...
Because, he's funny, eheh...
I mean, and you never know what he's gonna do
Never seeing eye to eye
Harmony destroyer
I believe in dreams tonight
I love you Verne Troyer
But If I don't cry (if I don't cry)
I'll be at peace tonight (I'll be at peace tonight)
Time to get you nice and high
Strap you in your moonshoes (Woop!)
Wish on a genie, ha ha ha
I want wishes too, ha
And why should I (and why should I)
Apologize? (Apologize?)
Ooh!
Ha ha, ha, ha ha ha
Ha ha, ha, ha ha ha
Never seeing eye to eye
