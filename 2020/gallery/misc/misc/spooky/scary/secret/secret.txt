Uh, hi.
I didn't think anyone would get here, so i will use this opportunity to explain some of my choices for this project.
I was quoting Nietzsche, because recently he was really relatable to me. not only what he was saying, but under further examination, he acted like me too.
Stopping caring for meaningless shit, such as homework? anyway, you probably did not hear Nietzsche's quote, To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering. you wanna know why? because no one gives a shit about what i think. nobody gives a shit about what my boy nietsy here said.
and no one will ever care about what i said.
