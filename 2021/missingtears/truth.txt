I..I.. Don't know anymore.
Life is really hard recently, and with everything just stacking on top it gets worse and worse.
I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing has sense anymore, and i feel it won't change soon.
I feel like i'm torn apart, I cannot finish anything. neither a file, nor homework or anything school related.
I don't have the motivation to do anything anymore really.
Most of the stuff that had any sort of attraction for me, or entarntainment, most of it is gone.
Nothing does it for me anymore.
I don't know what happened, but work really is the only thing left for me, and i'm shit at it.
I need help, but i don't know who to ask.
I am going insane.
