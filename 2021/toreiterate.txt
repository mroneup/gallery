this is fucking hell
like actually\
i dont know if i have the power to do this shitty thing anymore
let alone tell people about it
if you give a shit, you can look on my painful reflections on the sociopolitical state of our world in the commit comments here: https://github.com/mroneup/gallery/commits/main
if you don't, what are you doing here?
no one is forcing you to be here.
i don't care anymore.
i could just delete this.
i probably will.
all kinds of shady people will bring this out for everyone to see.
best way to end this now, no?
