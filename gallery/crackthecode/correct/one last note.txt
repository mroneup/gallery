Hi. You really came far to reach this, Huh? All this stuff, just to reach this note.
I spent a lot of time on this.
Like, a lot.
2 months.
2 months, of sweat, blood, tears, and various caffeinated drinks, to create this.
It's awful, i know it, but for me this is my way to express myself.
I'm sorry i made you sit through this.
I really am.
and all i have to say, is happy christmas.
Try to lower suicide rates in december.
And thanks.
