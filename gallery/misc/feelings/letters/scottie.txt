Dear Scottie,
We have met not so long ago, yet i can sense, probably just like Moon, a bond, connecting our lovely group.
But yet, as you probably know, I am not the greatest in relationships. to be honest, i am just scared. I am scared of intimacy.
I dont know why, but all i know it's that if we want to really reach something great, there are two options:
-Drop me
-help me get through it.
but as you probably see, both of those could be quite hard to follow through. I know it may sound silly, but this is a real problem for me.
I understand if you decide to leave. I promise, to never make it sour. 
All i ask for, that if we ever part ways, i want you to remember me, or remind yourself of me once a year.
