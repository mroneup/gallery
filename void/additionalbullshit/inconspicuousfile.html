  I wish that you get some cool gifts and have a nice time during your birthday!<br>
  I like you and you are epic :)<br>
  I know life is hard, but I'm here for you.<br>
  I like you probably the most from everyone in our class,<br>
  so i decided to make this for you.<br>
  You are quite a nice person, even if you have some issues<br>
  I wanna help you get through those if you want.<br>
  I wanna play some games together again.<br>
  Playing OMORI with you was nice, even though i was shit scared!<br>
  Do you wanna do it again some time?<br>
