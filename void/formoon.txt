Hey Emily.
Thanks for that letter yesterday, i really appreciate it.
I just wanted to say, I love you. 
I love the way you talk, the way you interact with me and other people, i love to hear you laugh.
I just feel ok near you.
I don't know how you always feel, because i'm not always near you, But i love you.
I hope this works out in the long run, I can't wait to meet you in person, and eat some of that ice cream together, just like we said.
I love every moment we have together, and I can't wait to have even more of them with you.
I'm sorry if it souns clingy, it's just what i feel
