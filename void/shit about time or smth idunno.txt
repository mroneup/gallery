the only thing i am scared of except dying alone is the fact that i will never be able to do everything like i did tommorow
that i wont be anle to change it
every day i am an inch closer to the end
and the inevitable march of time is what makes it a true place of suffering
after death it's over
no more love
no more life
no more of those calm evenings
and no more tears
